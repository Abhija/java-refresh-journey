		 * object. The size of this memory is determined by the class's instance
		 * variables (empName, empID, salary).
		 *
		 * 2. Initialization ðŸ’¡: All instance variables are initialized to their
		 * **default values** (e.g., empName = null, empID = 0, salary = 0.0).
		 *
		 * 3. Constructor Call ðŸ”¨: The **constructor** is executed. It performs any
		 * custom setup or overrides the default values (e.g., if you had 'new
		 * Employee("Bob")').
		 *
		 * 4. Reference Return ðŸ”—: The **memory address** (reference) of the newly
		 * created object is returned and assigned to the variable (e.g., 'myEmployee').
