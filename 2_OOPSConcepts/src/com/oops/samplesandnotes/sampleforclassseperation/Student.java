     * WHY USE 'this' KEYWORD HERE?
     * -----------------------------
     * 1. Clarity (Primary Reason here) üìñ: It explicitly shows that you are
     * accessing the instance fields (the object's state) vs. a local variable.
     *
     * 2. Preventing Shadowing (Most Common General Use) üõ°Ô∏è:
     * It is REQUIRED when a method parameter or local variable has the same name
     * as an instance field (e.g., in a constructor like: this.name = name;).
     * In getDetails(), it is optional but adds clarity.
